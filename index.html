          <p>An action-puzzle game where you solve puzzles and fight enemies with magnetism. Made in a team of six master level game design students at Aalto University in 2018-2019. My main responsibilities were collaborative game design, level design, game balance, and programming. I was also presenting the game in various events.</p>
          <p>I made my master's thesis about the level design of the game, focusing on how to support emergent gameplay through level design, allowing the player to discover new unplanned ways to interact with the game's mechanics and physics engine.<p>
          <p>Plusminus won the jury award of CHI Play 2018 Student Game Design Competition and was a finalist for Bit1 2019. I was also presenting it at the Game Developer Conference 2019 Experimental Gameplay Workshop in a team of two, and at the Nordic Game Conference 2018.</p>

          <h2>Who?</h2>
          <p class="lead">I’m Lora or Laura Sandberg and I’m on my epic journey to become a game creator like no one ever was. I’m an open-minded person, an enthusiastic team player, and always ready to learn something new.</p>
          <p>Video games have been a big part of my life ever since I played my first Super Mario before I was self-aware. In 2009, I decided to follow my passion and started studying game design and development in Oulu Vocational College, and ever since I have been working with games in a way or another. I enjoy working on game projects on my free time and I participate actively in game jams. For me, game development is a way to use my passion and experience in video games to create something that people can enjoy and love.</p>
          <p>I believe strongly in player-centric design, and I think that as a designer my role is not to tell players how to play a game, but to discover in what ways they enjoy it the most and change the design accordingly.<p>
          <p>Adventure, exploration and discovery are something I greatly value in games, and I love creating games around these themes. However, I appreciate a wide range of different type of games and love trying out new kinds. I have also spent plenty of time playing online and offline multiplayer games usually in teams, and I often find myself playing these games on quite high level.</p>
          <p>I started web development in 2007, and I’ve been doing it ever since. I’ve made many websites about various topics that interest me on my free time. I have also worked as an admin for several web communities.</p>
          <p>Finally, for now I feel it's relevant to mention that I am a transgender woman, and how I present myself is currently in a process of change. While this does not affect my professional abilities, I wish to be open about this to avoid any confusion.</p>
